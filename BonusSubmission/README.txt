Hey Dear BODEK! 

welcome to our bonus. 

it is comprised of two core features: 

1. We recognized that using triangles alone you are able to render almost any object.
we studied 3D image formats and wrote a program to convert .obj files into the format used in our exercise.
Thus - we are able to render any 3D object!

attached is an example of a 3D yoda image we rendered. yoda is comprised of 600+ triangles!
(see yodaStillImage1 and 2)

2. The second part of our project is creating an animation from a series of still images. 
 the first challenge was writing a program to automatically generate a series of scenes from one scene. 

we invented an algorithm in order to ensure that the looking point is always on the object of interest, and in order
to ensure it is completely in sight. 

then we generated a series of stills where the camera does a 360 rotation around the object. 

the result is attached as an mp4 file named: theYodaFilm
